# Simple Godot UI Demo
This is my first tutorial demo for Godot beginners, mainly focused on how I deal with UI's in Godot.
I believe that this demo will be useful for you if you are beginner or you still confused about Godot's UI.

## About the Project
**This is the source file for my blog post.
You can find more details in my blog or in the excalidraw file**
### Demo is built with Godot 4.4 dev7 (I used export tooltip buttons)
- F1 to toggle DEBUG UI
- ESC to get removed from the existence
- Excalidraw presentation is included in this repo. You can import to [Excalidraw](excalidraw.com)
- [Blog Guide](https://eakyrtk.com/how-to-make-ui-in-godot-4/)

## A Word for Beginners
Don't feel like this must be something hard, complicated or code heavy.
You'll see actually how little code it takes to make this work! 

And thank you all for giving this a read <3

## Topics include:

- How to design and organize your 
UI so it doesn't keep broking in every change


## Also You'll Have Optional Homework:
### Easy

- Make so that player can't buy if there is not enough money for the item
- Add a debug button that connects to the '_place_every_item' in GUI Manager
- Play with the themes
### Easy++++
- Design your own slot
- Instead of vertical slide, experiment with other ui elements (grid, horizontal)
